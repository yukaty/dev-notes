## pip install
Install package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
```
pip install <package>
```

Install package from a Git repository
```
pip install git+https://github.com/psf/requests.git
```

Install the packages listed in a requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## pip list vs. pip freeze

Both `pip list` and `pip freeze` list installed packages.

### pip list
Use `pip list` to check installed packages and their versions in an easy-to-read format.

Example output:
  ```
  Package              Version
  -------------------- -------
  Django                5.0.2
  ```

### pip freeze
Use `pip freeze` to record project dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file.

Example output:
  ```
  Django==3.2.7
  ```

**Note:**
Only packages directly related to the project are included in requirements.txt. Therefore, packages required for environment configuration, such as pip, are typically not included.


## requirements.txt

Creating a `requirements.txt` file lists all of the packages your project needs to run.
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- `requirements.in`: Written manually, and lists only the direct dependencies of your project.
- `requirements.txt`: Generated by `pip-compile`, and includes all dependencies with specific pinned versions.
