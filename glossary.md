## Web

### API Schema

API schema is a document that defines the structure and behavior of an API, including the endpoints, parameters, and response formats.

**OpenAPI Specification** is one of the common schema description formats for RESTful APIs.

### Endpoints

Endpoints generally refer to URLs used in APIs and web services. More specifically, they are specific URLs for accessing resources or services on a server.
